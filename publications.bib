  abstract = "Cancer is a disease intrinsic to multicellularity. Within a
              species, body size and lifespan are strongly correlated with
              cancer risk; between species, however, this correlation no longer
              holds. This phenomena, known as Peto’s Paradox, requires that
              species evolve cancer suppression mechanisms alongside increases
              in size and lifespan. Previous studies have identified instances
              of tumor suppressor duplications in large, long-lived species,
              suggesting a greater role for gene duplication in resolving Peto’s
              Paradox. Thus, in this thesis, I identified all protein-coding
              gene duplications in available genomes to determine if tumor
              suppressor pathways were enriched among duplicated genes in large,
              long-lived species. Then, I selected two hits in large, long-lived
              species to characterize in primary fibroblasts, and determine
              their effects on cell cycle and cell death in response to stress:
              LIF in the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and TP53 in the
              Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus). To determine if tumor
              suppressors gene duplications are more common in large-bodied
              Atlantogenatans, I used a Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT strategy to
              obtain copy numbers of all protein-coding genes in Atlantogenatan
              genomes. From an initial set of 18,011 protein-coding genes, I
              identified a median of 13,880 genes in Atlantogenatan genomes, of
              which a median of 940 genes are duplicated. Just as body size
              fluctuates throughout Atlantogenata, tumor suppressor genes also
              duplicated throughout the phylogenetic tree; furthermore, many of
              them remain transcriptionally active in extant elephants.
              Together, the data suggest that the duplication of tumor
              suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size
              in Atlantogenata. The resurrection and re-functionalization of a
              LIF pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions in elephants
              and their extinct relatives (Proboscideans) may have played a role
              in resolving Peto’s Paradox. LIF6 is transcriptionally
              up-regulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage, and translocates
              to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic
              analyses of living and extinct Proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates
              its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of
              large body sizes in the Proboscidean stem-lineage. These results
              suggest that re-functionalizing of a pro-apoptotic LIF pseudogene
              may have been permissive (though not sufficient) for the evolution
              of large body sizes in Proboscideans. In the long-lived bat,
              Myotis lucifugus, I describe a duplication of the TP53-WRAP53
              locus which may play a role in shaping its unique stress response.
              While pseudogene copies of TP53 are common in Myotis bats, M.
              lucifugus has a unique, syntenic duplication of TP53-WRAP53 that
              has conserved both regulatory and transcriptional functionality.
              Relative to 4 other closely related bat species (M. evotis, M.
              thysanodes, M. yumanensis, and E. fuscus), the M. lucifugus
              demonstrates a unique resistance to DNA damage and generalized
              oxidative stress, resembling the phenotype of a TP53-WRAP53 locus
              duplication in a previously-described transgenic mouse model.
              Overall, these results suggest that gene duplication plays an
              important role in Peto’s Paradox. While tumor suppressor
              duplications may facilitate the evolution of increased lifespans
              and body sizes in the short term, my work suggests the need for a
              polygenic or omnigenic model for Peto's Paradox in order to
              comprehensively lay this question to rest.",

              senescence of human cells is mediated by telomere shortening,
              Parrinello et al. demonstrated that senescence of mouse cells is
              caused by extreme oxygen sensitivity. It was hypothesized that the
              striking difference in oxygen sensitivity between mouse and human
              cells explains their different rates of aging. To test if this
              hypothesis is broadly applicable, we cultured cells from 16 rodent
              species with diverse lifespans in 3\% and 21\% oxygen and compared
              their growth rates. Unexpectedly, fibroblasts derived from
              laboratory mouse strains were the only cells demonstrating extreme
              sensitivity to oxygen. Cells from hamster, muskrat, woodchuck,
              capybara, blind mole rat, paca, squirrel, beaver, naked mole rat
              and wild-caught mice were mildly sensitive to oxygen, while cells
              from rat, gerbil, deer mouse, chipmunk, guinea pig and chinchilla
              showed no difference in the growth rate between 3\% and 21\%

              fibroblasts is generally improved by maintaining cells in 3\%
              oxygen, the extreme oxygen sensitivity is a peculiarity of
              laboratory mouse strains, possibly related to their very long
              telomeres, and fibroblast oxygen sensitivity does not directly
              correlate with species' lifespan.",

               that recapitulate the main features of genomic data sets remains
               a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible
               thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of
               available genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference
               and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations
               still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These
               challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for
               species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear
               what information is required to produce simulations with a level
               of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The
               community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this
               barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population
               genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version
               of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six
               well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we
               report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim
               (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the
               species catalog and substantial additions to simulation
               capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the
               simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and
               provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through
               community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in
               the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across
               the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we
               have identified common sticking points and developed best
               practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe
               the input data required for generating a realistic simulation,
               suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information
               from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major
               considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further
               promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic
               simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them
               available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.",

              acute and prolonged hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of

              seals remains restricted by their at-sea inaccessibility. Hence,
              we developed a proliferative arterial endothelial cell culture
              model from elephant seals and used RNA-seq, functional assays, and
              confocal microscopy to assess the molecular response to prolonged
              hypoxia. RESULTS: Seal and human endothelial cells exposed to 1\%
              O2 for up to 6 h respond differently to acute and prolonged
              hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of the
              hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulator HIF-1α from angiogenic

              High maximal and spare respiratory capacity in seal cells after

              system is upregulated in seal endothelial cells during hypoxia,
              while this system remains static in comparable human cells.
              Furthermore, we found that in contrast to human cells, hypoxia
              exposure rapidly activates HIF-1 in seal cells, but this response
              is decoupled from the canonical angiogenesis pathway. These

              infectious disease. While traditional approaches using genetic
              screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental
              processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess
              the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with
              complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics
              at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic
              interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of
              years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich
              species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living
              clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated
              traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary
              genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines
              for 8 closely-related (~11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in
              phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens
              of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy
              number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell
              lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer
              resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across
              bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has
              some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across
              mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the
              long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models.
              Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response
              to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats.
              This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans,
              which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of
              zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of
              leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits

  abstract = "Failures of the lysosome-autophagy system are a hallmark of aging
              and many disease states. As a consequence, interventions that
              enhance lysosome function are of keen interest in the context of
              drug development. Throughout the biomedical literature,
              evolutionary biologists have discovered that challenges faced by
              humans in clinical settings have been resolved by non-model
              organisms adapting to wild environments. Here, we used a primary
              cell culture approach to survey lysosomal characteristics in
              selected species of the genus Mus. We found that cells from M.
              musculus, mice adapted to human environments, had weak lysosomal
              acidification and high expression and activity of the lysosomal
              enzyme β-galactosidase, a classic marker of cellular senescence.
              Cells of wild relatives, especially the Mediterranean mouse M.
              spretus, had more robustly performing lysosomes and dampened
              β-galactosidase levels. We propose that classic laboratory models
              of lysosome function and senescence may reflect characters that
              diverge from the phenotypes of wild mice. The M. spretus phenotype
              may ultimately provide a blueprint for interventions that
              ameliorate lysosome breakdown in stress and disease.",
