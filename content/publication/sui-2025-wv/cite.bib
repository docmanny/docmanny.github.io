 abstract = {Failures of the lysosome-autophagy system are a hallmark of aging
and many disease states. As a consequence, interventions that
enhance lysosome function are of keen interest in the context of
drug development. Throughout the biomedical literature,
evolutionary biologists have discovered that challenges faced by
humans in clinical settings have been resolved by non-model
organisms adapting to wild environments. Here, we used a primary
cell culture approach to survey lysosomal characteristics in
selected species of the genus Mus. We found that cells from M.
musculus, mice adapted to human environments, had weak lysosomal
acidification and high expression and activity of the lysosomal
enzyme β-galactosidase, a classic marker of cellular senescence.
Cells of wild relatives, especially the Mediterranean mouse M.
spretus, had more robustly performing lysosomes and dampened
β-galactosidase levels. We propose that classic laboratory models
of lysosome function and senescence may reflect characters that
diverge from the phenotypes of wild mice. The M. spretus phenotype
may ultimately provide a blueprint for interventions that
ameliorate lysosome breakdown in stress and disease.},
