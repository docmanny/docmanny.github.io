abstract: Failures of the lysosome-autophagy system are a hallmark of aging and many
  disease states. As a consequence, interventions that enhance lysosome function are
  of keen interest in the context of drug development. Throughout the biomedical literature,
  evolutionary biologists have discovered that challenges faced by humans in clinical
  settings have been resolved by non-model organisms adapting to wild environments.
  Here, we used a primary cell culture approach to survey lysosomal characteristics
  in selected species of the genus Mus. We found that cells from M. musculus, mice
  adapted to human environments, had weak lysosomal acidification and high expression
  and activity of the lysosomal enzyme β-galactosidase, a classic marker of cellular
  senescence. Cells of wild relatives, especially the Mediterranean mouse M. spretus,
  had more robustly performing lysosomes and dampened β-galactosidase levels. We propose
  that classic laboratory models of lysosome function and senescence may reflect characters
  that diverge from the phenotypes of wild mice. The M. spretus phenotype may ultimately
  provide a blueprint for interventions that ameliorate lysosome breakdown in stress
  and disease.
