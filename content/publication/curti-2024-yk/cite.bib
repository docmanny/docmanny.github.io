 abstract = {The Yuma myotis bat (Myotis yumanensis) is a small vespertilionid
bat and one of 52 species of new world Myotis bats in the
subgenus Pizonyx. While M. yumanensis populations currently
appear relatively stable, it is one of 12 bat species known or
suspected to be susceptible to white-nose syndrome, the fungal
disease causing declines in bat populations across North America.
Only two of these 12 species have genome resources available,
which limits the ability of resource managers to use genomic
techniques to track the responses of bat populations to
white-nose syndrome generally. Here we present the first de novo
genome assembly for Yuma myotis, generated as a part of the
California Conservation Genomics Project. The M. yumanensis
genome was generated using a combination of PacBio HiFi long
reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing technology. This
high-quality genome is one of the most complete bat assemblies
available, with a contig N50 of 28.03 Mb, scaffold N50 of 99.14
Mb, and BUSCO completeness score of 93.7%. The Yuma myotis
genome provides a high-quality resource that will aid in
comparative genomic and evolutionary studies, as well as inform
conservation management related to white-nose syndrome.},
