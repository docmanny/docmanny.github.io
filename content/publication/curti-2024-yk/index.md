abstract: The Yuma myotis bat (Myotis yumanensis) is a small vespertilionid bat and
  one of 52 species of new world Myotis bats in the subgenus Pizonyx. While M. yumanensis
  populations currently appear relatively stable, it is one of 12 bat species known
  or suspected to be susceptible to white-nose syndrome, the fungal disease causing
  declines in bat populations across North America. Only two of these 12 species have
  genome resources available, which limits the ability of resource managers to use
  genomic techniques to track the responses of bat populations to white-nose syndrome
  generally. Here we present the first de novo genome assembly for Yuma myotis, generated
  as a part of the California Conservation Genomics Project. The M. yumanensis genome
  was generated using a combination of PacBio HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity
  sequencing technology. This high-quality genome is one of the most complete bat
  assemblies available, with a contig N50 of 28.03 Mb, scaffold N50 of 99.14 Mb, and
  BUSCO completeness score of 93.7%. The Yuma myotis genome provides a high-quality
  resource that will aid in comparative genomic and evolutionary studies, as well
  as inform conservation management related to white-nose syndrome.
