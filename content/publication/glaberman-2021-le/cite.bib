 abstract = {There are many costs associated with increased body size and
longevity in animals, including the accumulation of genotoxic and
cytotoxic damage that comes with having more cells and living
longer. Yet, some species have overcome these barriers and have
evolved remarkably large body sizes and long lifespans, sometimes
within a narrow window of evolutionary time. Here, we demonstrate
through phylogenetic comparative analysis that multiple turtle
lineages, including Galapagos giant tortoises, concurrently
evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced cancer risk. We
also show through comparative genomic analysis that Galapagos
giant tortoises have gene duplications related to longevity and
tumor suppression. To examine the molecular basis underlying
increased body size and lifespan in turtles, we treated cell
lines from multiple species, including Galapagos giant tortoises,
with drugs that induce different types of cytotoxic stress. Our
results indicate that turtle cells, in general, are resistant to
oxidative stress related to aging, whereas Galapagos giant
tortoise cells, specifically, are sensitive to endoplasmic
reticulum stress, which may give this species an ability to
mitigate the effects of cellular stress associated with increased
body size and longevity.},
