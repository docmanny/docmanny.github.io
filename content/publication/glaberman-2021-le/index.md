abstract: There are many costs associated with increased body size and longevity in
  animals, including the accumulation of genotoxic and cytotoxic damage that comes
  with having more cells and living longer. Yet, some species have overcome these
  barriers and have evolved remarkably large body sizes and long lifespans, sometimes
  within a narrow window of evolutionary time. Here, we demonstrate through phylogenetic
  comparative analysis that multiple turtle lineages, including Galapagos giant tortoises,
  concurrently evolved large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced cancer risk. We also
  show through comparative genomic analysis that Galapagos giant tortoises have gene
  duplications related to longevity and tumor suppression. To examine the molecular
  basis underlying increased body size and lifespan in turtles, we treated cell lines
  from multiple species, including Galapagos giant tortoises, with drugs that induce
  different types of cytotoxic stress. Our results indicate that turtle cells, in
  general, are resistant to oxidative stress related to aging, whereas Galapagos giant
  tortoise cells, specifically, are sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which
  may give this species an ability to mitigate the effects of cellular stress associated
  with increased body size and longevity.
