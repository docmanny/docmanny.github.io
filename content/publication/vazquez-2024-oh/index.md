abstract: The rich species diversity of bats encompasses extraordinary adaptations,
  including extreme longevity and tolerance to infectious disease. While traditional
  approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental
  processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation
  required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures.
  In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the
  genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years
  of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the
  genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution
  of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary
  genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related
  (~11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using
  genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and
  copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify
  new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions
  both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan
  in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals,
  and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using
  primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation
  in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This
  is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute
  to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results
  demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics
  of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships
  between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.
