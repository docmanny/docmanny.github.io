 abstract = {The rich species diversity of bats encompasses extraordinary
adaptations, including extreme longevity and tolerance to
infectious disease. While traditional approaches using genetic
screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental
processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess
the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with
complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics
at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic
interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of
years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich
species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living
clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated
traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary
genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines
for 8 closely-related (~11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in
phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens
of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy
number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell
lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer
resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across
bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has
some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across
mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the
long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models.
Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response
to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats.
This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans,
which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of
zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of
leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits
with implications for human health and suggest important
pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and
cancer resistance.},
