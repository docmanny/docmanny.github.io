 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elephant seals exhibit extreme hypoxemic tolerance
derived from repetitive hypoxia/reoxygenation episodes they
experience during diving bouts. Real-time assessment of the
molecular changes underlying protection against hypoxic injury in
seals remains restricted by their at-sea inaccessibility. Hence,
we developed a proliferative arterial endothelial cell culture
model from elephant seals and used RNA-seq, functional assays, and
confocal microscopy to assess the molecular response to prolonged
hypoxia. RESULTS: Seal and human endothelial cells exposed to 1%
O2 for up to 6 h respond differently to acute and prolonged
hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of the
hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulator HIF-1α from angiogenic
signaling. Rapid upregulation of genes involved in glutathione
(GSH) metabolism supports the maintenance of GSH pools, and
intracellular succinate increases in seal but not human cells.
High maximal and spare respiratory capacity in seal cells after
hypoxia exposure occurs in concert with increasing mitochondrial
branch length and independent from major changes in extracellular
acidification rate, suggesting that seal cells recover oxidative
metabolism without significant glycolytic dependency after hypoxia
exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the glutathione antioxidant
system is upregulated in seal endothelial cells during hypoxia,
while this system remains static in comparable human cells.
Furthermore, we found that in contrast to human cells, hypoxia
exposure rapidly activates HIF-1 in seal cells, but this response
is decoupled from the canonical angiogenesis pathway. These
results highlight the unique mechanisms that confer extraordinary
tolerance to limited oxygen availability in a champion diving
mammal.},
