abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Elephant seals exhibit extreme hypoxemic tolerance derived
  from repetitive hypoxia/reoxygenation episodes they experience during diving bouts.
  Real-time assessment of the molecular changes underlying protection against hypoxic
  injury in seals remains restricted by their at-sea inaccessibility. Hence, we developed
  a proliferative arterial endothelial cell culture model from elephant seals and
  used RNA-seq, functional assays, and confocal microscopy to assess the molecular
  response to prolonged hypoxia. RESULTS: Seal and human endothelial cells exposed
  to 1% O2 for up to 6 h respond differently to acute and prolonged hypoxia. Seal
  cells decouple stabilization of the hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulator
  HIF-1α from angiogenic signaling. Rapid upregulation of genes involved in glutathione
  (GSH) metabolism supports the maintenance of GSH pools, and intracellular succinate
  increases in seal but not human cells. High maximal and spare respiratory capacity
  in seal cells after hypoxia exposure occurs in concert with increasing mitochondrial
  branch length and independent from major changes in extracellular acidification
  rate, suggesting that seal cells recover oxidative metabolism without significant
  glycolytic dependency after hypoxia exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the glutathione
  antioxidant system is upregulated in seal endothelial cells during hypoxia, while
  this system remains static in comparable human cells. Furthermore, we found that
  in contrast to human cells, hypoxia exposure rapidly activates HIF-1 in seal cells,
  but this response is decoupled from the canonical angiogenesis pathway. These results
  highlight the unique mechanisms that confer extraordinary tolerance to limited oxygen
  availability in a champion diving mammal.'
