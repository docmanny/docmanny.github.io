abstract: While there exists a clear correlation between size, lifespan, and cancer risk between individuals of a species, this correlation does not hold when comparing across species, a phenomenon known as Peto's Paradox. Bats represent an ideal clade to study this paradox, as the large number of extant members - combined with the recent divergence time of the order - preserves a detailed record of the various genetic changes underlying their diversity in body size and lifespan. Previous work performed by our group revealed that the long-lived bat, *Myotis lucifugus*, has 8 copies of TP53, a central regulator of the DNA damage response present in all living organisms. Two of these copies, the canonical locus plus a second full-locus duplication, are unique to *M. lucifugus*, and show high levels of transcription in publically-available RNA-seq studies. We show that these two loci are expressed in primary cell lines of different *M. lucifugus* individuals, and contribute to an enhanced DNA damage response in *M. lucifugus* relative to 4 other closely related bat species (*M. evotis*, *M. thysanodes*, *M. yumanensis*, and *E. fuscus*). These results contribute to our understanding of how pre-existing tumor suppressor mechanisms have been enhanced through gene duplication to resolve Peto's Paradox in large, long-lived organisms."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Bats are extraordinarily long-lived relative to other mammals; among them, *Myotis lucifugus* is one of the longest-lived bats. While *M. lucifugus* and other closely-related species of bats have been the focus of research for a long time, there have been no reported cases of cancer in the literature - despite their long lifespan - suggesting that they have a low lifetime risk of cancer. In this bat, we find that there is a duplication of the TP53-WRAP53 locus, which is the only such known duplication among sequenced species. The two loci show active transcription both *in vivo* and *in vitro* in primary fibroblasts, suggesting that they are both functional. The responses to DNA damage response in *M. lucifugus* relative to its closest relatives is reminiscient of the effects of a TP53-WRAP53 duplication in transgenic mouse models, suggesting that this duplication may play an important role in mediating the cancer resistance of *M. lucifugus*.
