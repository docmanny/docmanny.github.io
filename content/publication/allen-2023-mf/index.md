abstract: Elephant seals experience extreme hypoxemia during diving bouts. Similar
  depletions in oxygen availability characterize pathologies including myocardial
  infarction and ischemic stroke in humans, but seals manage these repeated episodes
  without injury. However, the real-time assessment of the molecular changes underlying
  protection against hypoxic injury in seals remains restricted by their at-sea inaccessibility.
  Hence, we developed a proliferative arterial endothelial cell culture system to
  assess the molecular response to prolonged hypoxia. Seal and human cells exposed
  to 1% O 2 for up to 6 h demonstrated differential responses to both acute and prolonged
  hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of the hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional
  regulator HIF-1α from angiogenic signaling at both the transcriptional and cellular
  level. Rapid upregulation of genes involved in the glutathione (GSH) metabolism
  pathway supported maintenance of GSH pools and increases in intracellular succinate
  in seal but not human cells during hypoxia exposure. High maximal and spare respiratory
  capacity in seal cells after hypoxia exposure occurred in concert with increasing
  mitochondrial branch length and independent from major changes in extracellular
  acidification rate, suggesting seal cells recover oxidative metabolism without significant
  glycolytic dependency after hypoxia exposure. In sum, our studies show that in contrast
  to human cells, seal cells adapt to hypoxia exposure by dampening angiogenic signaling,
  increasing antioxidant protection, and maintaining mitochondrial morphological integrity
  and function.
