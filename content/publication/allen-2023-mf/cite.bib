 abstract = {Elephant seals experience extreme hypoxemia during diving bouts.
Similar depletions in oxygen availability characterize pathologies
including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in humans, but
seals manage these repeated episodes without injury. However, the
real-time assessment of the molecular changes underlying
protection against hypoxic injury in seals remains restricted by
their at-sea inaccessibility. Hence, we developed a proliferative
arterial endothelial cell culture system to assess the molecular
response to prolonged hypoxia. Seal and human cells exposed to 1%
O 2 for up to 6 h demonstrated differential responses to both
acute and prolonged hypoxia. Seal cells decouple stabilization of
the hypoxia-sensitive transcriptional regulator HIF-1α from
angiogenic signaling at both the transcriptional and cellular
level. Rapid upregulation of genes involved in the glutathione
(GSH) metabolism pathway supported maintenance of GSH pools and
increases in intracellular succinate in seal but not human cells
during hypoxia exposure. High maximal and spare respiratory
capacity in seal cells after hypoxia exposure occurred in concert
with increasing mitochondrial branch length and independent from
major changes in extracellular acidification rate, suggesting seal
cells recover oxidative metabolism without significant glycolytic
dependency after hypoxia exposure. In sum, our studies show that
in contrast to human cells, seal cells adapt to hypoxia exposure
by dampening angiogenic signaling, increasing antioxidant
protection, and maintaining mitochondrial morphological integrity
and function.},
