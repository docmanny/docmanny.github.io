 abstract = {Pacific Ocean rockfishes (genus Sebastes) exhibit extreme
variation in life span, with some species being among the most
long-lived extant vertebrates. We de novo assembled the genomes
of 88 rockfish species and from these identified repeated
signatures of positive selection in DNA repair pathways in
long-lived taxa and 137 longevity-associated genes with direct
effects on life span through insulin signaling and with
pleiotropic effects through size and environmental adaptations. A
genome-wide screen of structural variation reveals copy number
expansions in the immune modulatory butyrophilin gene family in
long-lived species. The evolution of different rockfish life
histories is coupled to genetic diversity and reshapes the
mutational spectrum driving segregating CpGâ†’TpG variants in
long-lived species. These analyses highlight the genetic
innovations that underlie life history trait adaptations and, in
turn, how they shape genomic diversity.},
