abstract: Pacific Ocean rockfishes (genus Sebastes) exhibit extreme variation in life
  span, with some species being among the most long-lived extant vertebrates. We de
  novo assembled the genomes of 88 rockfish species and from these identified repeated
  signatures of positive selection in DNA repair pathways in long-lived taxa and 137
  longevity-associated genes with direct effects on life span through insulin signaling
  and with pleiotropic effects through size and environmental adaptations. A genome-wide
  screen of structural variation reveals copy number expansions in the immune modulatory
  butyrophilin gene family in long-lived species. The evolution of different rockfish
  life histories is coupled to genetic diversity and reshapes the mutational spectrum
  driving segregating CpGâ†’TpG variants in long-lived species. These analyses highlight
  the genetic innovations that underlie life history trait adaptations and, in turn,
  how they shape genomic diversity.
