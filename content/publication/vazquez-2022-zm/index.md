abstract: 'The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan
  within species, but there is no correlation between cancer and either body size
  or lifespan between species indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved
  enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Previously we showed that several large bodied
  Afrotherian lineages evolved reduced intrinsic cancer risk, particularly elephants
  and their extinct relatives (Proboscideans), coincident with pervasive duplication
  of tumor suppressor genes (Vazquez and Lynch, 2021). Unexpectedly, we also found
  that Xenarthrans (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) evolved very low intrinsic
  cancer risk. Here, we show that: (1) several Xenarthran lineages independently evolved
  large bodies, long lifespans, and reduced intrinsic cancer risk; (2) the reduced
  cancer risk in the stem lineages of Xenarthra and Pilosa coincided with bursts of
  tumor suppressor gene duplications; (3) cells from sloths proliferate extremely
  slowly while Xenarthran cells induce apoptosis at very low doses of DNA damaging
  agents; and (4) the prevalence of cancer is extremely low Xenarthrans, and cancer
  is nearly absent from armadillos. These data implicate the duplication of tumor
  suppressor genes in the evolution of remarkably large body sizes and decreased cancer
  risk in Xenarthrans and suggest they are a remarkably cancer-resistant group of
  mammals.'
