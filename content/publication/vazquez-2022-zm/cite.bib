 abstract = {The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and
lifespan within species, but there is no correlation between
cancer and either body size or lifespan between species
indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced
cancer protection mechanisms. Previously we showed that several
large bodied Afrotherian lineages evolved reduced intrinsic
cancer risk, particularly elephants and their extinct relatives
(Proboscideans), coincident with pervasive duplication of tumor
suppressor genes (Vazquez and Lynch, 2021). Unexpectedly, we also
found that Xenarthrans (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters)
evolved very low intrinsic cancer risk. Here, we show that: (1)
several Xenarthran lineages independently evolved large bodies,
long lifespans, and reduced intrinsic cancer risk; (2) the
reduced cancer risk in the stem lineages of Xenarthra and Pilosa
coincided with bursts of tumor suppressor gene duplications; (3)
cells from sloths proliferate extremely slowly while Xenarthran
cells induce apoptosis at very low doses of DNA damaging agents;
and (4) the prevalence of cancer is extremely low Xenarthrans,
and cancer is nearly absent from armadillos. These data implicate
the duplication of tumor suppressor genes in the evolution of
remarkably large body sizes and decreased cancer risk in
Xenarthrans and suggest they are a remarkably cancer-resistant
group of mammals.},
