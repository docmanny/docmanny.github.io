abstract: 'Marine mammals are integral to global biodiversity and marine health through
  their roles in coastal, benthic, and pelagic ecosystems. Marine mammals face escalating
  threats from climate change, pollution, and human activities, which perturb their
  oceanic environment. The diverse biology and extreme adaptations evolved by marine
  mammals make them important study subjects for understanding anthropogenic pressures
  on marine ecosystems. However, ethical and logistical constraints restrict the tractability
  of experimental research with live marine mammals. Additionally, studies on the
  effects of changing ocean environments are further complicated by intricate gene-environment
  interactions across populations and species. These obstacles can be overcome with
  a comprehensive strategy that involves a systems-level approach integrating genotype
  to phenotype using rigorously defined experimental conditions in vitro and ex vivo.
  A thorough analysis of the interactions between the genetics of marine mammals and
  their exposure to anthropogenic pressures will enable robust predictions about how
  global environmental changes will affect their health and populations. In this perspective,
  we discuss four challenges of implementing such non-invasive approaches across scientific
  fields and international borders: 1) practical and ethical limitations of in vivo
  experimentation with marine mammals, 2) accessibility to relevant tissue samples
  and cell cultures; 3) open access to harmonized methods and datasets and 4) ethical
  and equitable research practices. Successful implementation of the proposed approach
  has the potential impact to inspire new solutions and strategies for marine conservation.'
