 abstract = {Marine mammals are integral to global biodiversity and marine
health through their roles in coastal, benthic, and pelagic
ecosystems. Marine mammals face escalating threats from climate
change, pollution, and human activities, which perturb their
oceanic environment. The diverse biology and extreme adaptations
evolved by marine mammals make them important study subjects for
understanding anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems.
However, ethical and logistical constraints restrict the
tractability of experimental research with live marine mammals.
Additionally, studies on the effects of changing ocean
environments are further complicated by intricate
gene-environment interactions across populations and species.
These obstacles can be overcome with a comprehensive strategy
that involves a systems-level approach integrating genotype to
phenotype using rigorously defined experimental conditions in
vitro and ex vivo. A thorough analysis of the interactions
between the genetics of marine mammals and their exposure to
anthropogenic pressures will enable robust predictions about how
global environmental changes will affect their health and
populations. In this perspective, we discuss four challenges of
implementing such non-invasive approaches across scientific
fields and international borders: 1) practical and ethical
limitations of in vivo experimentation with marine mammals, 2)
accessibility to relevant tissue samples and cell cultures; 3)
open access to harmonized methods and datasets and 4) ethical and
equitable research practices. Successful implementation of the
proposed approach has the potential impact to inspire new
solutions and strategies for marine conservation.},
