abstract: Differences in the way human and mouse fibroblasts experience senescence
  in culture had long puzzled researchers. While senescence of human cells is mediated
  by telomere shortening, Parrinello et al. demonstrated that senescence of mouse
  cells is caused by extreme oxygen sensitivity. It was hypothesized that the striking
  difference in oxygen sensitivity between mouse and human cells explains their different
  rates of aging. To test if this hypothesis is broadly applicable, we cultured cells
  from 16 rodent species with diverse lifespans in 3% and 21% oxygen and compared
  their growth rates. Unexpectedly, fibroblasts derived from laboratory mouse strains
  were the only cells demonstrating extreme sensitivity to oxygen. Cells from hamster,
  muskrat, woodchuck, capybara, blind mole rat, paca, squirrel, beaver, naked mole
  rat and wild-caught mice were mildly sensitive to oxygen, while cells from rat,
  gerbil, deer mouse, chipmunk, guinea pig and chinchilla showed no difference in
  the growth rate between 3% and 21% oxygen. We conclude that, although the growth
  of primary fibroblasts is generally improved by maintaining cells in 3% oxygen,
  the extreme oxygen sensitivity is a peculiarity of laboratory mouse strains, possibly
  related to their very long telomeres, and fibroblast oxygen sensitivity does not
  directly correlate with species' lifespan.
