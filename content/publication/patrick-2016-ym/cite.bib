 abstract = {Differences in the way human and mouse fibroblasts experience
senescence in culture had long puzzled researchers. While
senescence of human cells is mediated by telomere shortening,
Parrinello et al. demonstrated that senescence of mouse cells is
caused by extreme oxygen sensitivity. It was hypothesized that the
striking difference in oxygen sensitivity between mouse and human
cells explains their different rates of aging. To test if this
hypothesis is broadly applicable, we cultured cells from 16 rodent
species with diverse lifespans in 3% and 21% oxygen and compared
their growth rates. Unexpectedly, fibroblasts derived from
laboratory mouse strains were the only cells demonstrating extreme
sensitivity to oxygen. Cells from hamster, muskrat, woodchuck,
capybara, blind mole rat, paca, squirrel, beaver, naked mole rat
and wild-caught mice were mildly sensitive to oxygen, while cells
from rat, gerbil, deer mouse, chipmunk, guinea pig and chinchilla
showed no difference in the growth rate between 3% and 21%
oxygen. We conclude that, although the growth of primary
fibroblasts is generally improved by maintaining cells in 3%
oxygen, the extreme oxygen sensitivity is a peculiarity of
laboratory mouse strains, possibly related to their very long
telomeres, and fibroblast oxygen sensitivity does not directly
correlate with species' lifespan.},
