 abstract = {Aging is a nearly inescapable trait among organisms yet lifespan
varies tremendously across different species and spans several
orders of magnitude in vertebrates alone. This vast phenotypic
diversity is driven by distinct evolutionary trajectories and
tradeoffs that are reflected in patterns of diversification and
constraint in organismal genomes. Age-specific impacts of
selection also shape allele frequencies in populations, thus
impacting disease susceptibility and environment-specific
mortality risk. Further, the mutational processes that spawn this
genetic diversity in both germline and somatic cells are strongly
influenced by age and life history. We discuss recent advances in
our understanding of the evolution of aging and lifespan at
organismal, population, and cellular scales, and highlight
outstanding questions that remain unanswered.},
