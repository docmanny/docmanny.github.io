abstract: Aging is a nearly inescapable trait among organisms yet lifespan varies
  tremendously across different species and spans several orders of magnitude in vertebrates
  alone. This vast phenotypic diversity is driven by distinct evolutionary trajectories
  and tradeoffs that are reflected in patterns of diversification and constraint in
  organismal genomes. Age-specific impacts of selection also shape allele frequencies
  in populations, thus impacting disease susceptibility and environment-specific mortality
  risk. Further, the mutational processes that spawn this genetic diversity in both
  germline and somatic cells are strongly influenced by age and life history. We discuss
  recent advances in our understanding of the evolution of aging and lifespan at organismal,
  population, and cellular scales, and highlight outstanding questions that remain
  unanswered.
