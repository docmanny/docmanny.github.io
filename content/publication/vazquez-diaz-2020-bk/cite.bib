 abstract = {Cancer is a disease intrinsic to multicellularity. Within a
species, body size and lifespan are strongly correlated with
cancer risk; between species, however, this correlation no longer
holds. This phenomena, known as Peto’s Paradox, requires that
species evolve cancer suppression mechanisms alongside increases
in size and lifespan. Previous studies have identified instances
of tumor suppressor duplications in large, long-lived species,
suggesting a greater role for gene duplication in resolving Peto’s
Paradox. Thus, in this thesis, I identified all protein-coding
gene duplications in available genomes to determine if tumor
suppressor pathways were enriched among duplicated genes in large,
long-lived species. Then, I selected two hits in large, long-lived
species to characterize in primary fibroblasts, and determine
their effects on cell cycle and cell death in response to stress:
LIF in the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and TP53 in the
Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus). To determine if tumor
suppressors gene duplications are more common in large-bodied
Atlantogenatans, I used a Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT strategy to
obtain copy numbers of all protein-coding genes in Atlantogenatan
genomes. From an initial set of 18,011 protein-coding genes, I
identified a median of 13,880 genes in Atlantogenatan genomes, of
which a median of 940 genes are duplicated. Just as body size
fluctuates throughout Atlantogenata, tumor suppressor genes also
duplicated throughout the phylogenetic tree; furthermore, many of
them remain transcriptionally active in extant elephants.
Together, the data suggest that the duplication of tumor
suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size
in Atlantogenata. The resurrection and re-functionalization of a
LIF pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions in elephants
and their extinct relatives (Proboscideans) may have played a role
in resolving Peto’s Paradox. LIF6 is transcriptionally
up-regulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage, and translocates
to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic
analyses of living and extinct Proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates
its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of
large body sizes in the Proboscidean stem-lineage. These results
suggest that re-functionalizing of a pro-apoptotic LIF pseudogene
may have been permissive (though not sufficient) for the evolution
of large body sizes in Proboscideans. In the long-lived bat,
Myotis lucifugus, I describe a duplication of the TP53-WRAP53
locus which may play a role in shaping its unique stress response.
While pseudogene copies of TP53 are common in Myotis bats, M.
lucifugus has a unique, syntenic duplication of TP53-WRAP53 that
has conserved both regulatory and transcriptional functionality.
Relative to 4 other closely related bat species (M. evotis, M.
thysanodes, M. yumanensis, and E. fuscus), the M. lucifugus
demonstrates a unique resistance to DNA damage and generalized
oxidative stress, resembling the phenotype of a TP53-WRAP53 locus
duplication in a previously-described transgenic mouse model.
Overall, these results suggest that gene duplication plays an
important role in Peto’s Paradox. While tumor suppressor
duplications may facilitate the evolution of increased lifespans
and body sizes in the short term, my work suggests the need for a
polygenic or omnigenic model for Peto's Paradox in order to
comprehensively lay this question to rest.},
