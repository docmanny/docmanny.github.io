abstract: Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development
  and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features
  of genomic data sets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations
  are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available
  genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However,
  implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge.
  These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that
  are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required
  to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer
  a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this
  barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using
  up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing
  this framework using six well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020).
  Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version
  0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial
  additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the
  simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific
  genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of
  species in the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across the tree
  of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common
  sticking points and developed best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations.
  We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest
  good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss
  common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to
  further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations,
  especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible
  to everyone.
