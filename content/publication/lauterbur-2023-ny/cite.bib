 abstract = {Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods
development and empirical research, but producing simulations
that recapitulate the main features of genomic data sets remains
a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible
thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of
available genetic data, and to the sophistication of inference
and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations
still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These
challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for
species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear
what information is required to produce simulations with a level
of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The
community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this
barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population
genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version
of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six
well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we
report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim
(version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the
species catalog and substantial additions to simulation
capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the
simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and
provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through
community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in
the catalog more than three-fold and broadened coverage across
the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we
have identified common sticking points and developed best
practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe
the input data required for generating a realistic simulation,
suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information
from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major
considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further
promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic
simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them
available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.},
