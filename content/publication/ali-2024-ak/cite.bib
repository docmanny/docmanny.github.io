 abstract = {The ex situ population of the endangered black-footed ferret
(Mustela nigripes) has been experiencing declines in reproductive
success over the past 30 years of human-managed care. A potential
cause may be environmental-dependent inbreeding depression with
diet being one of the contributing factors since ferrets are not
fed their natural diet of prairie dogs. Here, we generated and
analyzed semen proteome and transcriptome data from both wild and
ex situ ferrets maintained on various diets. We identified 1757
proteins across all samples, with 149 proteins unique to the
semen of wild ferrets and forming a ribosomal predicted
protein-protein interaction cluster. Wild ferrets also differed
from ex situ ferrets in their transcriptomic profile, showing
enrichment in ribosomal RNA processing and potassium ion
transport. Successful fertility outcomes documented for ex situ
ferrets showed the strongest association with the semen
transcriptome, with enrichment in genes involved in translation
initiation and focal adhesion. Fertility also synergized with the
effect of diet on differentially expressed transcriptomes, mainly
affecting genes enriched in mitochondrial function. Our data and
functional networks are important for understanding the causes
and mechanisms of declining fertility in the ex situ ferret
population and can be used as a resource for future conservation
efforts.},
