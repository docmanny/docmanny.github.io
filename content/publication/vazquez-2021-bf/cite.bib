 abstract = {The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and
lifespan within species. Between species, however, there is no
correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan,
indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced
cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives
(Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the
exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented
cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently
within a clade of smaller-bodied species (Afrotherians). Here, we
explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and
cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly, we found that tumor
suppressor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes,
rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans, however,
have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects
of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest
that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the
evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing
intrinsic cancer risk.},
