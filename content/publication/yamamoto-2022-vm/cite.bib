 abstract = {Age is the primary risk factor for many common human diseases.
Here, we quantify the relative contributions of genetics and
aging to gene expression patterns across 27 tissues from 948
humans. We show that the predictive power of expression
quantitative trait loci is impacted by age in many tissues.
Jointly modelling the contributions of age and genetics to
transcript level variation we find expression heritability (h2)
is consistent among tissues while the contribution of aging
varies by >20-fold with [Formula: see text] in 5 tissues. We find
that while the force of purifying selection is stronger on genes
expressed early versus late in life (Medawar's hypothesis),
several highly proliferative tissues exhibit the opposite
pattern. These non-Medawarian tissues exhibit high rates of
cancer and age-of-expression-associated somatic mutations. In
contrast, genes under genetic control are under relaxed
constraint. Together, we demonstrate the distinct roles of aging
and genetics on expression phenotypes.},
