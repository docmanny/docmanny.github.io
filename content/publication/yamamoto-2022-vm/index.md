abstract: "Age is the primary risk factor for many common human diseases. Here, we\
  \ quantify the relative contributions of genetics and aging to gene expression patterns\
  \ across 27 tissues from 948 humans. We show that the predictive power of expression\
  \ quantitative trait loci is impacted by age in many tissues. Jointly modelling\
  \ the contributions of age and genetics to transcript level variation we find expression\
  \ heritability (h2) is consistent among tissues while the contribution of aging\
  \ varies by >20-fold with [Formula: see text] in 5 tissues. We find that while the\
  \ force of purifying selection is stronger on genes expressed early versus late\
  \ in life (Medawar's hypothesis), several highly proliferative tissues exhibit the\
  \ opposite pattern. These non-Medawarian tissues exhibit high rates of cancer and\
  \ age-of-expression-associated somatic mutations. In contrast, genes under genetic\
  \ control are under relaxed constraint. Together, we demonstrate the distinct roles\
  \ of aging and genetics on expression phenotypes."
