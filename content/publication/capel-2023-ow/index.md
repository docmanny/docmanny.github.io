abstract: Abstract Townsend’s big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii, is a cave- and
  mine-roosting species found largely in western North America. Considered a species
  of conservation concern throughout much of its range, protection efforts would greatly
  benefit from understanding patterns of population structure, genetic diversity,
  and local adaptation. To facilitate such research, we present the first de novo
  genome assembly of C. townsendii as part of the California Conservation Genomics
  Project (CCGP). Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity
  sequencing technologies were used to produce a de novo genome assembly, consistent
  with the standard CCGP reference genome protocol. This assembly comprises 391 scaffolds
  spanning 2.1 Gb, represented by a scaffold N50 of 174.6 Mb, a contig N50 of 23.4
  Mb, and a benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) completeness score
  of 96.6%. This high-quality genome will be a key tool for informed conservation
  and management of this vulnerable species in California and across its range.
