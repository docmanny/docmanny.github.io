 abstract = {Abstract Townsend’s big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii, is a
cave- and mine-roosting species found largely in western North
America. Considered a species of conservation concern throughout
much of its range, protection efforts would greatly benefit from
understanding patterns of population structure, genetic diversity,
and local adaptation. To facilitate such research, we present the
first de novo genome assembly of C. townsendii as part of the
California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Pacific
Biosciences HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity
sequencing technologies were used to produce a de novo genome
assembly, consistent with the standard CCGP reference genome
protocol. This assembly comprises 391 scaffolds spanning 2.1 Gb,
represented by a scaffold N50 of 174.6 Mb, a contig N50 of 23.4
Mb, and a benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO)
completeness score of 96.6%. This high-quality genome will be a
key tool for informed conservation and management of this
vulnerable species in California and across its range.},
