#     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Puerto Rican biologist studying the evolution of exceptional longevity and healthspan in animals such as bats and whales. I employ a "farm-to-table" genomics approach that unites fieldwork, cellular and molecular biology, and functional population-scale genomics to tackle questions in aging across all levels of life. In addition to my work in aging, I strive to eliminate all barriers to people's success in STEM, and to democratize access to science through outreach and training programs.

Pedagogy and inclusivity are at the heart of my academic program. Science only has meaning when its fruits are widely and openly shared with all; furthermore, science is only beneficial and benevolent when its fruits are available equally to all. As such, I am always seeking more opportunities to reach out and promote STEM to any and all groups and identities!
